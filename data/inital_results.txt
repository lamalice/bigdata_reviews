0 This is a charming version of the classic Dicken's tale.  Henry Winkler makes a good showing as the "Scrooge" character.  Even though you know what will happen this version has enough of a change to make it better that average.  If you love A Christmas Carol in any version, then you will love this.

0 It was good but not as emotionally moving as the the Christmas Carol by Dickens  I like Christmas movies that make me sigh

0 Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of &#34;An American Christmas Carol.&#34;  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.  Ayyyyy!

0 Henry Winkler is very good in this twist on the classic story. Not a conventional remake, but a version of the story set in early America. Give it a try.

0 This is one of the best Scrooge movies out.  Henry Winkler outdoes himself.  The casting is excellent and the music and theme old but very relevant.

0 This has been a favorite movie of mine for a long time.  Henry winkler is great as a modern day Scrooge.  There are many movies giving a new twist to Dickens, but this one is true to the original story.  It is set during the depression.

0 This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of "A Christmas Carol."Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past.

0 Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.

0 A good Christmas carol dhenry winkler one during the depression. Henry winkler does a good job.a classic film I recommend for all ages.

0 How a bitter old man comes to know the true meaning of Christmas. Realizing to late his lost love and life.

0 The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual &#34;must watch&#34; story for me.

0 Even though i don't care for Henry Winklers  acting i liked this movie it fit him real good ThanksDale

0 My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Chrismas Carol.

0 The first time I saw &#34;An American Christmas Carol&#34; I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.CA Luster

0 Set in the USA about the time of the depression it is an update of that old familiar story of redemption.  The story is classic and this one is as good as all the rest.  Henry Winkler is good in this role.

0 I really enjoy all the &#34;Christmas Carol-Scrooge&#34; movies. I own all the ones I know about and watch them each year. I want to add this one to my collection as it is a different take on the traditional ones.

0 This is a wonderful movie. It stay faithful to A Christmas Carol, but it very American. A fun movie for one and all.

0 Anorher good movie for holiday watchers..a little twist from the ordinary scrooge movie. Enjoyable. What couldn't you like from the fons.

0 Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge.  It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.

0 Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.The acting is splendid and the story is well written. It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.

1 We began watching this video, but stopped it a short way into it when we realized this was not what we had hoped for.  It was too contrived and predictable.

0 It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.  This one is the best by far!  It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.  The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.

0 I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.  All in  all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money.

0 This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.  This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.  It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.  I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;

0 I can't believe how long it took &#34;them&#34; to get this wonderful Christmas show on DVD. It's a modern (1930s America) twist on Charles Dickens' classic tale. Winkler makes me hate his character as much as Alister Sim did in his portrayal of Scrooge in the 1951 production. Certainly one for your visual library.

0 Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film.

0 A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.  Well written and well acted, Henry Winkler shines as a young entrepreneur who is more interested in wealth and progress than romance and family, until...  I don't want to give it away.  Trust me. You'll love it.

0 A great acting job by Henry Winkler. I saw this many years ago and it'll always be a Christmas favorite.

0 Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge.  This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen.  Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude.  I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD.  You'll love it!

0 The title says it all - this is a Christmas carol re-done. Henery Winkler play the part of Scrooge in this American version of the timeless Classic It is well worth the investment if you are a collector of the Christmas carol stories.

0 Henry Winkler does an amazing job as scrooge in this tale, he is an awesome actor, I really like sitting down to watch this movie on a cold night.

0 An updated version of A Christmas Carol that doesn't lose any of the important stuff. Great movie for the family.

0 Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur "The Fonz" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.

0 Henry Winkler is excellent. The only thing I have to say is, there was too much time spent on his Christmas past. I got bored with it. Otherwise, it was good and worth the money.

0 When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 2
0 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.

0 Winkler does a little over-the-top in his role as the scrooge character and the production values leave somewhat more to be desired but all-in-all a nice rendition for holiday viewing.

0 Henry Winkler makes this delightfull Dickens variant a treasure of its own.  (In Blu Ray now - yes!)  This great actor has always been a welcome see.

0 This is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the Depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in England during the time of Dickens.

0 I liked Mr Winklers pertrayal of a depression error Ebineser. He played the part of promising, driven young man, to unmoraled business man, to kind hearted senior citizen quite well. It was not a big Holywood production. But for a made for TV Movie it was quite good.

0 I have always loved this rendition of A Christmas Carol with it's american twist.  I had it on VHS but finally gave up my player for a DVD player.Previously only bootlegged copies were available.  I was very happy to find it recently produced on DVD/Bluray.It is a great Holiday movie.

0 He did a great job as a Scrooge type character. I truly enjoyed this film. I liked him from the Happy Days show.

0 This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens &#8220;Christmas Carol&#8221;, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see.

0 this movie stars henry winkler. an enjoyable christmas tale. he was superb in this role. a twist on the old &#34;scrooge&#34;.

0 I got this for a person who has it on vhs and needed it replaced. They wanted to keep it in there collection. Thank you for the promptness of receiving it.

0 Trying to make Dickens relevant again, this dresses him up in American hard times and values. Winkler is always a pleasure to watch. I don't know, however, how Winkler would have Dickens speak if set in post-2007 American, though.

0 I watched this when it came out on tv way back when, and I have looked for it ever since. I was so shocked when I saw it on here and I just had to have it. WATCH THIS, IT IS GREAT!!

0 My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.Both spins are great, this just adds to an already powerful Christmas message.

1 This is a first for me, I didn't like this movie and I think I only had it on for about 2
0 minutes.  Acting just wasn't there.

0 Henry Winkler is one of my favorite actors of all time.  He is wonderful in An American Christmas Carol!  This is another movie that has not been shown at Christmas in the last few years, but should be.  So glad that I could get it for my collection of favorite Christmas movies.

0 Henry Winkler does a great acting job as he protrays &#34;Mr. Scrooge.&#34; Here again one the whole family can enjoy!

0 I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.

0 This is one of my favorites... I was very happy to see it on this site. Henry Winkler  played this part well.

0 Henry Winkler plays a great part in this movie, brings it to life! Good modern version of Scrooge! Don't miss this classic

0 It didn't grab our attention enough to finish it.  It was probably okay if it was the first Christmas movie you watched this season.

0 Henry Winkler is the one of the best Scrooge I've seen! We see a lot of Scrooge movies this was a breath of fresh air.

0 This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to

0 How coincidental that this program, aired by ABC in 1979, is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 3
0 years later, in 2009, experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character, Benedict Slade, really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens, I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production.

0 Great American Versions of the Dickens's Classic.Enjoyed it very much This video is worth buying.It has a modern view of a &#34;Christmas Carol&#34;.

0 Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim.

0 This is a version of A Christmas Carol, that most haven't seen.  It is done well and Henry Winkler plays a perfect scrooge.  I love it!

0 Although my husband prefers the original Christmas carol, he does like this as well.  I love it. Henry Winkler is very good in this movie. A nice change from the original Christmas carol movies.

0 This is my favorite Christmas Carol movie. I have waited for it to come out, and when I finally looked it up again, I bought it!

0 I have always enjoyed this movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blue Ray and the quality is excellent.  I have no complaints and am very pleased to buy from Amazon.

0 I love An American Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler.  In my opinion it is the very best version of Scrooge.  Hope everyone sees it and enjoys it as much as I do.

0 This is one of my fav versions....set during the Depression in America. It's unique regarding Scrooge's upbringing in an orphanage (when he repossess the orphanage's piano on  Christmas Eve!)

0 Just  OK, I had a a hard time putting &#34;Fonzie&#34; as a gruff person, and to me it was just OK, glad I watched it but not one of my favorites.

0 We watch this every year, as well as the original story with George C. Scott....good contrast in stories and wonderful treats.

0 I liked this production giving the possible American point of view.  We've all seen the original Christmas Carol but I'd highly recommend this to anyone.  We watched this with our grandchildren whose interest was kept the entire length.

0 I 'collect' movie versions of 'A Christmas Carol', This is a very good one. It is true to the spirit of the book while putting an American spin on it. If you really like Dicken's story you will probably enjoy this version.

0 This remake of the Dickens original is effective and realistic portrayal of life during the depression, and it is fun ot watch Henry Winkler in the lead role.

0 Henry Winkler just did not seem like Scrooge. It felt more like an actor playing Scrooge. In other words, I could not enjoy it as well as some of the other actors as Scrooge. Alistair Sim or Patrick Stewart were much better as Scrooge.

0 If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison.Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in "Dickensian" England.2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.

0 This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale.

0 Another entry in the retelling of the classic.  Ho hum from start to finish.  Henry Winkler is not believable as a Scrooge type.

0 Henry Winkler does an excellent job as the stingy Mr Slade.  The counterpart to Ebeneezer Scrooge in this adaptation of the classic story.  It was wonderfully done.

0 Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However, it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit, and partly to my own blame, I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called "must have Christmas movies" then pass it up for another title.

1 Christmas brings at least a couple of Christmas Carol stories. This one was more updated in time. I prefer the old ones, but it doesn't mean that this one was bad, just my personal preference.

0 If you are looking for something different in your Scrooge this is it.  Winkler does a superb job of acting in this movie.  It follows a different slant on the old classic.  It reveals a new depth to character of Scrooge.  Don't watch this one every year but still worth it.  A must for your Dickens collection.

0 Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.

0 If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special "jump start" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.Paul Race, editor, Family Garden Trains(tm)

0 Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can,t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;.  Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34; ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!

0 Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.

0 I have searched for this film for years and finally found it here on Amazon. Saw it on television years ago and it was one I knew I wanted.

0 Not the best quality DVD, but it's a great story. I recommend it to all.

0 Being a huge fan of this classic, I own dozens of versions and this one  adds a nice variety.  The twists and changes to this timeless story truly  do justice to the original and the performances, for the most part, are  stellar.  If you're looking for the same feel good movie but in a new  setting, this one's for you.

0 A friend put me on to this a few years back when he asked me to find it for him on DVD.  A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three "ghosts" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the "romantic" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.  Overall, a worthy addition to your collection of Christmas Carol movies.  Also, kudos to Image entertainment for re-releasing this at a reasonable price and getting rid of the dreaded snap-case.

0 A must have for anyone who loves the Charles Dickens original. A great holiday movie for the family.

0 Henry Winkler turns in one of the most moving performances he has ever done, and the scenes with this films version of "Tiny Tim" will bring a tear, I don't care who you are!It's become part of our Christmas favorites!

0 A wonderful story about the Christmas Spirit & how it changed the life of a very lonely, old miser.  A true witness that it is ''NEVER TOO LATE''  to open up you heart & life to others.

0 Among the best of this beloved Christmas story; We enjoy Henry Winkler's twist on Scrooge and the story-line. He makes for a very believable Scrooge, both pre and post &#34;redemption&#34;!

0 This is one of the best Christmas stories out there.It was on T.V 15 or 2
0 years ago, I've been trying to track it down ever since.It's the Christmas Carol - Scrooge story but with a new twist.It takes place in America during the depression.Received the product in excellent condition, in the expected time.At a good price.

0 I had forgotten about this movie til I saw it on Amazon. Loved it when it came out and still do. The Fonz is really cool in this modern holiday classic.

0 I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.

0 Very well done, Henry Winkler is a smooth guy. Close to the original story line, so is fun to watch from an American perspective.

0 93 Snazzes on the 10
0 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes."Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""Thank God," Slade responds."It's worse," Latham says.A short while later Slade says "But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""Evil isn't just what you do," Latham replies, "It's also what you DON'T do."A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. "Did you read that book, Mister Slade?" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed."The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""Humbug?"

0 This is the classic story with a fresh look. I like it. I owned this on VHS and was pleasantly surprised to find it on disc.

0 This was an interesting take on the old &#34;Christmas Carol&#34; movies inspired by Dickens novel.  My husband loved it.  It is about people in the  depression era and it was interesting to see the scenery, clothes and furniture, etc.  The acting was very good, too.

0 Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year.

0 &#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all,but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story.

0 It has been years since I first saw this version of a Christmas Carol. I had remarked to my daughter that I would like to see the Christmas Carol version with Henry Winkler one day when we were discussing all the different versions. I was glad I was able to watch and enjoy it again.

0 I have always loved this version of A Christmas Carol, but the quality was always poor.  If you can get this on blu-ray, I recommend that.  This is a great movie, though.

0 It is pretty much the traditional Scrooge story, but set in America in about 1880.  It does give a twist to it to help Americans tie the story into a scene in their history.

0 An American Christmas Carol...based on the classic by Charles Dickens, &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34; Now that I've written something, you need to cut down the word number requirement. That's really stupid.

0 I collect all the (non-musical) versions of this story. This one is not seen often on TV. I watch it every Christmas. Good updated (1930's) version of the Dickens classic. TRY IT!! DVD has played well with no problems.

0 For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this "American-ized" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the "Ghost of Christmas Future" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their "Ghost of the Future" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like "A CHristmas Carol" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.

0 Henry Winkler was great and so was the cast.  I saw this years ago and very happy I could own it.  A great American take on an English classic.

0 We (my daughter and I) have collected just about every one of the DVD &#34;Christmas Carols&#34;... This was always a favorite of mine and We finally got a copy... It was great to watch it again..

0 I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player.Mr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are, Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet.I am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen.

0 I saw this for the first time in the 80s and liked the &#34;American&#34; twist on the Charles Dickens' classic. I love this story in all versions, as the first version for me was Mr. Magoo!!

0 A truly wonderfully made film, mostly accurate to scripture and brilliantly acted. Joseph's brothers are the stars here in their own right but Paul Mecurio is in fine form as well.

0 Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.

0 This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  "Hollywoodized" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one! Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials, and including a making-of featurette. Don't let this jewel get by you!

0 Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;) is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively.The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who &quot;does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death&quot; is worth watching again and again.

0 I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good, the costumes inhanced the film, and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't.

0 gave it as a gift to my sister she love it.  a good telling of the life of Joseph, son of jacob.

0 Magnificent acting, writing, directing, set design--the story is extremely compelling and the ending uplifting. It teaches many principles of virtue without in the least being preachy. There is much conflict, suspense, surprise, and believable twists in this absorbing drama. I watched it many times and learned many useful lessons from it. Buy it and enjoy it.

0 to see how they take a name from bible (JOSEPH)  and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days

0 One of the best-done Bible movies ever, if not the very best.  I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.  I wish Christians, in making Biblical movies, would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film.  Bravo!  I love this movie.

0 When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television, at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries, I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.This film, though, is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!

0 I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought the relationship between Potifer and his wife and his wife and Joseph really striking.  Several things that I had not thought of before.  Such as: why didn't Potifer have Joseph killed when his wife accused him of rape? and How did his brothers react to him after he became Pharaoh's advisor.

0 I would have to say that this is one of the best "made-for-TV" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal, the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so, I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)

0 I love the story of Joseph and his brothers.  As the world might say, a tale of Joseph,  Nothing in the Bible is a tale or fabricated as the world might say.  Love the actor also love Ben Kingsley.

0 Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month.

1 This movie is very inspirational to me, it helped me through my trails and tribulations during the time I needed it most, this movie relates to me.

0 This movie, JOSEPH, is in-depth and interesting. They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading "The Bible Collection." I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well. These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which is well worth the price.

0 I have watched this movie several times.  I really enjoy it.  It is an accurate account from the Bible.Thanks candpfoote

0 A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob ("Blessed be His name")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.

0 As the title says, unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him, which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife, Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through.

0 Having just seen this movie for the first time last night, I have to say that in spite of the very white actors in a culture that would clearly be darker in appearance, this movie in writing, production, and acting overcame that one glaring inconsistency with accuracy and with beauty.Bible in hand, we marveled to see that this story followed the actual biblical account with astounding accuracy almost never seen in biblical productions.  Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie.Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it &quot;really&quot; would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!

0 I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean, what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham.

0 I've watched this movie every six months or so for about 12 years or so.  Every time I'm touched.  It really is fantastic acting and a wonderful script.  Forgiveness is the main message and Joseph's character exemplifies it many times in this story.

0 The best movie ever seen and own. Its actually my favorite movie of all time. its worth to have, its so accurate from the bible. very inspiring and educational. Buy It

0 Although I had enjoyed the Bible movies that were broadcast by Turner on TNT, "Joseph" turned out to be a cut above the rest in regard to the scope of the production, the writing, and the performances of the actors. It really seemed to capture the essence of the story in the book of Genesis.

0 This portrayal of Joseph's story is very good.  It is biblically pretty accurate and features good performances by the actors.  I recommend it to individual and family audiences!  It's one of the great stories of the Bible.

0 I like anything that is biblical. I have bought a few of them in the past few weeks. The Ten Commandments and the Story of Ruth are my all time favorites.

0 No matter how many times I watch it, it is still very moving. Excellent acting, excellent adherence to the true story, and something I will soon not forget and enjoy watching again. I bought several copies to give as gifts.

0 This is an accurate and realistic depiction of Scripture. It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted, way too serious presentation. Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them. This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin), but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary, albeit tremendously faithful, man.

0 "Joseph" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.

0 I read the Bible quite often and teach Bible classes from time to time. This is a very accurate account of the &#34;Joseph&#34; story.

0 This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so...."slightly" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the "edit" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to "leaven the whole loaf" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the "Sampson" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.

0 This is a brilliant epic movie, a tour de force, the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception ofOne Night with the KingStarring Paul Mercurio in the title role, he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die, to keep to the word of his G-D.Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesmanThe movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive

0 Great great great! As with many of the other titles in the Bible Collection,  I've watched this film several times and the emotions I am left with after watching it never diminish. Another production that remains true to the historic account, this movie was casted brilliantly and told superbly. Before I ever read the story of Joseph in the Old Testament, I had watched this film. This movie did an excellent job of re-telling the story. Highly recommended.

0 I used this movie in my prison ministry bible study. It was very well done and followed the bible very closely. Joseph as revealed in the book of Genesis of the scripture is a type of Jesus and the movie brought this out which shows an obvious insight and knowledge do God's word. I would highly recommend this DVD for all family viewing.

0 this movie brought tears of jOY AND HAPPINESS to my eyes I can watch this movie over and over awesome movies

0 Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent

0 Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry.

0 I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a &#34;why me&#34; type.

0 joseph is one of my favorite movies. I can watch it over and over andnot get tired of watching it.

0 This is a fantastic movie or the retelling of the Story of Joseph.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic too.  The actors are great in each of their roles.  I'm glad I ordered this movie.  Saw it many years ago.

0 This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's &quot;My God, my God...&quot; speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0 This film is one of the better films made about stories of the Bible.  Very little poetic license was taken with it - they stuck to the scripture very closely and Sir Ben Kingsley is brilliant at Potipher.

0 This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode.  One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality.  Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films.  This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.

0 This one was really interesting!  Loved it completely.  Acting was exceptional.  It flowed so well.  I liked the temple of it.  Everything fell into place.  No fillers to eat up time.  This Movie is a Winner!

0 A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points

0 This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well.

0 This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School.  The youth were able to envision the Bible's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story.

0 Though it's been a while, I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that "disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)

0 This is my favorite movie of all times. It is so realistic that I cry every time I watch. The characters are extremely good in their acting, and I especially enjoyed the Joseph character, Paul Mercurio. I would definatly  recommend this movie!!

0 I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done, is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies, true to the Bible.

0 This movie is extremely well made. It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit. His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is.Exceptionally well made, I recommend this movie as high as possible.  A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding, forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been.

0 This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but, if there weren't, the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that, even though this is a family story, there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting, really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing, you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!

0 If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife, this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline "R" rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off, leaving his garment behind him, there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us, and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series, we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!

0 Acting was very good, the story line was well done and included all the important parts of the tale  without adding too much conjecture in.

0 This version I liked. Went behind the scenes. Not totally accurate but great version of this story.

0 As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences).

0 i buy films mainly for my family memebers as gifts. this is a great depiction of this story from the bible. very well done for the period it was taken from.

0 I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that.  I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher.  Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently.

0 Joseph is my favorite movie out of the Bible Collection. I am going to get one movie at a time as I can afford it until I have the whole collection.

0 A believable re-telling of the story while respecting it. Exceptional performances by stellar cast. And all of it at a great price!

0 There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  "Joseph" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  "Joseph" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.

0 This is the best and most accurate rendition of Joseph's life.  This is great for the family.

0 I recommend this movie, Joseph. It is a great reprentation of  of a truly kind, just, and merciful God and the people He loves. We all need positive and true to life movies that are not only good for the heart, but for the soul.

0 I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story. The sets were often lacking, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back. I was happy to get this at around $7.I recommend the Bible Collection highly.

0 I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well, even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but, have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby

0 The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.Watch it!

0 I'm always on the look out for quality films but especially for the holidays. I had seen this movie many years ago on television. I believe they made it into a mini series. The acting was wonderful. The story line uplifting. Great example of faith, hard work and being true to your beliefs no matter the circumstances and hardships.

0 This is my go to movie for when I need to be humble. This telling of Joseph is very, very close to the Bible, and that is what I was looking for. Sometimes when you purchase this movies it is strictly Hollywood version. This time they got it right.

0 Of all the TNT movies, this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)The movie is a solid PG movie.

0 This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel.  I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments.  I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!

0 This is one of my most favorite stories in the Bible, recommend this one to anyone who loves a good Bible story.

0 My son has been collecting the different books of the bible for a while now.  He is so excited that I am able to order these from Amazon.  He has a few more DVD'S that we need to order to complete his collection.  I'm am very pleased with the DVD and quick shipment.

0 I thought that this film was really good, i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.  I really liked the  end, it was so good, best part  in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the  story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit, it  makes you realize just how hard it was for him, that his own family would  betray him.  And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like  him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true.  His  brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved  Joseph more than them.  Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was  sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out, but because  God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family.

0 I really loved this movie ,it describes the biblical account pretty accurate. it starts w/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife, when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story.I was clued to the screen the whole time. Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance.

0 I had these three DVD, this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time. I believe it was in the late 1990,s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them. And then I  brought them on DVD. So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time. I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD. All were excellent.

0 This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others, but the effort is exemplary.

0 Just what I ordered. No surprises. I am a pastor and we just  finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie.

0 The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.

0 Very well done.  Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot.

0 I bought this film after seeing most of it on A&amp;E. This film is by far the best way to see Joseph. The settings are beautiful and the entire look of the production are perfect in presenting the story. The casting choices could not have been better! Paul Mercurio is a perfect Joseph. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. This film is the best Joseph movie to date.

0 TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END

0 Very good movie.  Another great Bible character truly comes to life and is a good message for the family.

0 This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden.

0 This movie is almost like the story of Joseph, thats written in the Bible. Joseph was a remarkable man! If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was, a wise man, who listened to God, and kept the Ten Commandments!Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man! I loved the way Joseph, and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley), became friends, and earned each others trust and respect, eventhough Joseph was still a slave.It always amazed me, how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers, especially after what they did to him! Joseph was a very wise, and brillant man! I highly recommend this movie, it is based on a very true, and awesome story, thats in the HOLY BIBLE! This movie is very good, and I loved it very much! You will end up watching it more than once!

0 Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her "please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear." The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the "prostitute" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very "PG-13" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his "lover," or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life. Great film!

0 "Joseph" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit, power, and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality, being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license, "Joseph" remains true to the Biblical narrative, even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture, lasting over 3 hours, but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. "Joseph" does have its weaknesses, yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact, it is so good, I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired, encouraged, and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!

0 This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.

0 This was a great DVD. It tells the story of Joseph and his family. Good for the whole family and great for reinforcing your knowledge of the Bible.

0 How wonderful that a story about precognitive dreams has become such a famous and beautiful story.  We are all wise to pay attention to our dreams, but not all of us have a talented and high-minded interpreter like Joseph.  Even Freud in "The Interpretation of Dreams" admits that precognitive dreams are not unusual.

0 Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart.

0 I must admit this bibical movie has it all.Passion,Suspense and Temptation.I think this is more for a mature audience.Due to some scenes in this film I wouldnt advise children to view it.But the cast and movie is wonderful.It's truly a movie worth watching!
