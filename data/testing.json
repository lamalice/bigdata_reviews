    "reviewText": "By the time this album came out, the Spice Girls were everywhere. They were on every magazine cover, they were on lollipops, books, they even had several series of dolls as well as 5 #1 hit songs. This album only added to it & to this day has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Face it, they sold more records than anyone since the Beatles & no one has yet to sell more than the Spice Girls did. They are a landmark in pop music, a legacy & without them, there would be no Britney or Christina.01. Spice Up Your Life (10/10)Yet another #1 hit for the girls, this song has great lyrics. And it was a clever way of marketing them. I was impressed by the video, it is very good. Great song.02. Stop (10/10)The one song that didn't reach #1 in the UK. I love this one. Geri's vocals are in my opinion the best part of this song. She sounds so sweet & perfect in her verses. Catchy lyrics...a perfect pop song.03. Too Much (10/10)One of my fav songs by them of all time. Just like 2 Become 1. I love the message & story behind this one. When you have it, it's too much...when you don't, it's not enough. GREAT lyrics.04. Saturday Night Divas (10/10)Another favorite of mine. I love Melanie C's part in the bridge. Her voice here amazes me. Emma's verses are also perfect. Nice song with original, different verses. Love it!05. Never Give Up On The Good Times (10/10)Alot of fans agree this would have been a great single. This is a great song with a great message to everyone. Especially to the girls. Be safe & don't get pregnant...live young while you can.06. Move Over (8/10)The Pepsi song, but it's great overall. Kind of a filler on this album, but its smooth rythm and raw vocals make up for it. Although I prefer the other Pepsi song \"Step To Me\" over this one. It is available on the Japanese version of this album.07. Do It (9/10)Another song with a great message! My mom didn't think so when this album first came out, but I agreed with everything they are saying & I still do. \"Rules are meant to be broken, do what suites you, not what they want you to do.\"08. Denying (10/10)Reminds me of my ex boyfriend denying he was actually gay. This is one of my favorites. \"You ain't foolin nobody but yourself.\" So true.09. Viva Forever (10/10)Gorgeous! Beautiful lyrics & melody. Saying goodbye to true love...I can relate to this deeper than alot of the other songs here. This song actually gives me chills, it's a haunting song. One of their best.10. The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10)Not one of my favorites, but it IS different. And it's a great way to end the album just like a concert...\"Ladies and gentlemen, we hope that you enjoyed the show!\"Overall this album is just as good as the original with just as much spice as the last. Geri, Emma, Mel C, Mel B & Victoria all have equal vocals on this one & they all sound amazing nonetheless. Actually this album is probably my favorite out of all three, and I do LOVE all three. So if you don't have this already, buy it used or something. It is fun. It makes you dance, cry & think alot. Not just a soundtrack, this is an ALBUM. Get it!",

The reason why I bought it is because I absolutely loved Spice, their debut album, and I thought this album would be good too.  Here are my reviews for Spiceworld:1) Spice Up Your Life- Awesome song to dance to! 10/102) Stop- A great song that has a Motown-like feel to it, although I hate Motown. I love this one anyway! 10/103) Too Much- Slow and upbeat. 9/104) Saturday Night Divas- Pretty cool. 9/105) Never Give Up On The Good Times- Excellent tune that sounds a bit disco-ish. 10/106) Move Over- A rock-tinged song that definitely rocks my world! 9/107) Do It- Love it! 9/108) Denying- A little slow, but equally awesome. 8/109) Viva Forever- Has a Spanish guitar sound to it, but sappy. 8/1010) The Lady Is A Vamp- A good song that has a fun swingy-like beat to it. 9/10I would recommend this CD to everybody!  I will keep it in my music collection for a long time.",

Sporty Spice (the odvious lead singer of the spice girls) takes the girls and the listeners to the journey of 4 min of sweet harmonies...The second song that is up there with &#34;too much&#34; is the rock inspired PEPSI song &#34;move over&#34;... this song gets to the point and fast: energizing and fun.Songs like &#34;denying&#34;, &#34;viva forever&#34;, and &#34;stop&#34; are planted in listeners minds after one listen...U just cannot get enough of these girls.... until GINGER SNAPS&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; LMMFAO!!!!!  but if the girls were still together they would have had maybe a year more or two...this LP is their best and it is worth every penny... if u loved the spice girls at one point in life....",

There are way too many bad guys in the film, who are plotting various things for the Spice Girls. In the end, we realize they're all good people, and this movie all leads up to a live concert, which is somewhat ironic, because the biggest thing I wondered after watching this film is if the Spice Girls actually recorded any of their own music.  Why do they sound like heavy smokers when they're talking, but that completely goes away when they're singing?Pros:+Fun, jovial movie+It has the Spice Girls+It has almost all of the Spice Girls' songs+It kind of indirectly hints at the origins of the Spice Girls' nicknamesCons:-They lip sync all of their songs, and it really shows-Bad sound editing-The tour bus is about three times wider on the inside than on the outside, and since they spend so much time in here, it's really distracting-Way too many extra bad guy story lines going on in the background",

    "reviewText": "Who doesn't remember this group?  You could truly say at one time these 5 sexy vixens dominated the world.  This group was pure gold, from their style to the very thing they stood for.  Each girl had an identity for people on all walks of life, from the cute (Baby) to sexy (Ginger).  From athletic (Sporty) to rich (Posh), and even just plain loose and crazy (Scary).  And together they represented the very message of \"Girl Power,\" a lingo that girls followed like the bible it's self.  And the music was certainly great as well.  The second time around they actually grew as vocalists, making their sophomore album Spice World even better than their debut.From the start one was in love the Latin driven \"Spice Up Your Life\", the pure pop \"Stop\", and the slick ballad \"Too Much\".  However, singles weren't all they had to offer.  Spice World was quick to back even more punch with the r&b; flavored \"Denying\" and the futuristic \"Move Over\" which was featured in a Pepsi commercial.  And things only got better with the let-your-hair-down song \"Saturday Night Divas\" and the perky \"Never Give Up on the Good Times\".  But the album hits pure gold with the slower ballad \"Viva Forever\" and the Frank Sinatra inspired \"The Lady Is a Vamp\", each brilliant in their own way.Spice World offered a lot more variety than it's predecessor.  This is what made the album an all around work of art.  Though it wasn't exactly critically acclaimed, probably due to that by the time this album dropped the Spice Girls were getting on people's nerves with over marketing.  But despite that, this album is purely original compared to what was out there at the time.  Girl power was what the crowd wanted to hear, and it's what they got, and it's girl power that drove Spice World to the top.",

The very succesful girl group had became a pop phenomenon with their debut \"Spice\" in 1996 and all of their singles had reached the number 1 spot in the UK so far. So what was next?. A second album with the same formula as their first with uptempo pop songs about friendship, girlpower and just alot of fun, but perhaps even sharper songwriting this time \"Spiceworld\" is a pleasant surprise that also sold in millions and had many new single hits. This album is also slightly expanding their music influences, not just fabricated pop and some of the girls also proves to be good singers too.\"Spice Up Your Life\" a extremly catchy uptempo with a latin flavour starts this album great an is undeniably one of their all time bests. \"Stop\" is also great and takes the best of Spice Girls with a nice hook and trademark pop melody. It only peaked at #2 on the UK charts and was the first single to do so, a major dissapointment for the group but at the time, Geri had sadly left the group after disputed and it was the beginning of the end. \"Too Much\" is a melancholy ballad that is a mix of soul and pop. Also chart topper. \"Saturday Night Divas\" is also a bluesy pop-soul song. The bridge on song sounds very much like Michael Jackson's \"Ghosts\", co-incidence?. Another feel-good song on \"Never Give Up on the Good Times\", perfect floor filler about having fun and never get old. \"Move Over\" is a spice trademark, but not one of the better. \"Do It\" continued the same trend with great pop. \"Denying\" is a midtempo, but quite forgettable. power-ballad \"Viva Forever\" was the last single to be released from this album and it also went at #1, sadly Geri had left and it felt like a goodbye song. In the memorable video none of girls appear in real life, but they are portraited as elfs. It's one of their best songs all categories. \"The Lady is a Vamp\", is a jazzy cabaret song, simular to Sinatra, while he sang \"Tramp\" this one is called Vamp and is an fascinating closer to another great album by the Spice Girls. A third album came, called \"Forever\" but it was released when their popularity had fallen and several of the girls had alrready started solo careers. It gave them 2 hits \"Holler\" and \"Goodbye\" though.Overall, The second and last good album by the spice girls when they were still at their peak. It's good, well crafted pop at it's best and it seems like they could turn anything to a hit at the time. It's a little more varied then their debut and some of the girls shows improved singing talents here too. Needless to say, if you liked \"Spice\" you are gonna love \"Spiceworld\". Great album.",

Even the most hardened Spice-hater (of which I am definitely one) should find something to like.The tongue-in-cheek approach taken by Spice World is what makes the movie work. The Spice Girls, while not Oscar-caliber actresses, do manage to pull off their roles with relative panache. (It helps that they're playing themselves.)However, there are frequent musical numbers, which (unless you're a fan of the Spice Girls' music) are painful to listen to.

Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In \"Spice World,\" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls \"interact\" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the \"telly\" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip.Alan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well.The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie.Overall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.",

The target audience of this movie won't realize this, but what we get is a collection of music videos very very loosely tied together around a number of dismal subplots.To give you some idea of the looseness of the subplots, some of them involved;A snooty bumbling reporter, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) filming a documentary on the \"real\" Spice Girls. He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.The movie also featured a bus with a Union Jack plastered all over it which was the Spiceworld tour bus. They must have put Dr Who's Tardis somewhere in this bus, since it was an awful lot bigger inside than outside, but never mind about that. Meatloaf drove the bus.",

Directed by television veteran Bob Spiers (&quot;Ab Fab&quot;), the movie  focuses on the girls during a few days in their hectic life, as they  prepare for their big gig at Royal Albet Hall in London.The movie's  camp factor helps in boosting the film's appeal with teenagers and  pop-culture fans, and although the acting is not that great, the film gives  us many hilarious scenarios including a Mission Impossible-based fantasy  called &quot;Spice Force 5,&quot; and an enjoyable photo shoot where the  girls imitate major pop icons of the past and themselves.The songs from  the band's first two albums provide the film's soundtrack with a diverse  selection of tunes that keeps the film together. I only wished that  producers released a compilation album of the band's songs that were  remixed for this film (&quot;Who do You Think You Are&quot; sounds wicked  in a techno beat).The film's other highlight includes multiple cameo  appearances by such personalities as Sir Elton John, Bob Geldof, Meatloaf,  Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore, George Wendt, and one of the actress from the  &quot;Ab Fab&quot; series. All give wonderful comic performances.The  film's worst scene involves the girls' encounter with aliens during a  midnight hike in the woods. Personally, this scene seems out-of-place in  such a film. Richard E. Grant is great as the girls' manager, and the  film's subplot of a tabloid thrasher going after the girls makes it much  more fun to watch.Reminiscent of a &quot;Hard Day's Night,&quot; Spice  World will garner more new fans throughout the year as the film is aired on  television and at midnight-movie festivals. If you want a fun, fun movie,  wthen this is it!",

    "reviewText": "Ten years after they first become famous, the Spice Girls recently toured again. It's all over now until they start to run low again on funds, but with their tour came a re-release of Spice World, the movie. Now I can honestly say, this film is no classic. But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.The story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.I was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.There's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested. (But they kept in the song \"Do You Want To Be In My Gang?\") Other famous faces are Michael Barrymore, Meatloaf, Elvis Costello, Alan Cumming, Neil Fox (in voice only thank God), Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Richard E Grant, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Roger Moore, Naoko Mori (now in Torchwood), Richard O'Brien, Jonathan Ross, Jennifer Saunders ... Phew. I bet I've missed someone out.Spice World is one of those films that you will be embarrassed to admit you own, but it's joined by many more in my DVD collection, so I'm not embarrassed in the slightest. It's harmless fun.",

The script is kind of boring and the acting performance of the girls are not great, just okay, well they acting like themself but Geri (Ginger Spice) My God she CAN'T act!  She can't sing also, what she's doing in a girls band and now in an movie???  Well she do have charisma and good stage presence, she is an interesting person, I guess that mostly why she is in the Spice Girls, she is driven but she sure can't sing, I sing better then her and I think I sing bad.lol:)  Well like I said if you like the Spice Girls you may like this movie, it got funny part in it but it's not the movie of the year.",

There were some really fun parts in the film, like when they  swapped roles, and dressed up as their favourite idols. (Nothing like  playing dress-ups!) I loved it when they sang the old Gary Glitter song.  They made fun of themselves a little, which is always a good thing.  They  may not be the most talented or gorgeous beings in the world, but at least  they don't make you want to die of sadness like a lot of acts today do  (well, depending on who you are!)  There's a need for more musicals in the  world, I think, and this is the closest we've gotten to one in the last  fifteen years...",

Here, at last, is a movie where one can miss 30 minutes of it and not miss any plot points.  It's the  kind of movie you shouldn't buy snacks for because there's no telling how  long they'll stay down.  This flick is as contrived and mindless as their  music.  But I suppose the point is that they made lots of money -- they  certainly got my brother's [money].  I suppose it's my own fault for  watching it. A good veiwing tip would be a full-frontal lobotomy.  Spice up  your life....",
